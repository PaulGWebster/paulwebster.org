## Initial goals


## Side projects / goals

Created entirely in windows for no other reason than to see how workable it is
for primary development

Some mojolicious development was done in WSL2 simply due to faster edits to
the source, this would not be strictly neccesary with volume mounts and a loader
such as hypotoad that could restart the perl/mojo process on source change.

With the above being said, I am not holding that against the test.

## Technologies used

* Perl
* Mojolicious
* PostgreSQL
* Docker
* Docker-compose
* VSCode - with a swath of plugins - Including the Docker one
